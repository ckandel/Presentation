Thank you everyone who came to this year's Python: Advanced Topics talk! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or recommendations about the presentation-- or Python/arcpy -- at aortego@esri.com.

This repository contains all of the presentation material for Esri's 2018 UC, "Python: Advanced Topics". Please note that all examples were shown using Python 3, but they should work for Python 2 as well.

In addition, I've included a few links which will help you learn more about Python and arcpy, as well as answers to some of the questions I received. Enjoy!

## Resources for learning Python and ArcPy

## Installing Jupyter
Jupyter is included with Pro, but you can install it here:
http://jupyter.org/install

## How to use Jupyter Notebooks with arcpy for Desktop (Python 2.7)
1. Install **32**-bit Anaconda from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. Install ArcGIS for Desktop (skip this if you already have it installed)
3. Move the file "Desktop 10.<x>.pth" from "C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.6\Lib\site-packages" to "C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda2"
4. Update Windows' Environmental Variables to use the python.exe installed by Anaconda, and you should be able to import arcpy from within a Jupyter Notebook.
